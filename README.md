# DAO Governance System — Hybrid On‑Chain / Off‑Chain Voting (Portfolio Project)

## Project Summary
This project implements a robust DAO governance framework on an EVM‑compatible blockchain. It showcases a secure, modular, and production‑style architecture for decentralized decision‑making, combining on‑chain execution with a conceptual off‑chain voting layer (Snapshot‑like).

Designed as a portfolio‑grade system, the project demonstrates real‑world governance mechanics used by modern DAOs, including proposal management, token‑weighted voting, quorum enforcement, delayed execution, and treasury control.

## Core Capabilities

- Governance token with delegation and vote snapshots  
- Token‑weighted proposal voting  
- Proposal threshold enforcement  
- Quorum‑based approval system  
- Timelocked execution for security  
- DAO‑controlled treasury contract  
- Event‑driven design for off‑chain indexing  
- Simulated Snapshot‑style off‑chain voting attestation  
- Emergency pause via multisig authority  
- High‑coverage automated testing  
- Dockerized reproducible environment  

---

## System Architecture

The governance system consists of four primary smart contracts working together:

### 1) Governance Token (GOVToken)
An ERC‑20 token with advanced voting capabilities.

**Key responsibilities**
- Distributes governance power
- Supports vote delegation
- Maintains historical voting checkpoints
- Enables signature‑based delegation (gasless UX)

Built using OpenZeppelin’s audited extensions.

---

### 2) Timelock Controller (DAOTimelock)
Adds a mandatory delay between approval and execution.

**Why it matters**
- Prevents rushed or malicious actions
- Gives stakeholders time to react
- Acts as a safety buffer for governance decisions

All successful proposals must pass through this contract before execution.

---

### 3) Governor Contract (DAOGovernor)
The central coordination layer for governance.

**Handles**
- Proposal creation and validation
- Voting lifecycle management
- Quorum checks
- Proposal state transitions
- Queueing and execution via timelock
- Integration of off‑chain vote attestations

Lifecycle example:

Pending → Active → Succeeded → Queued → Executed

---

### 4) Treasury Contract
Stores DAO funds and executes approved transfers.

**Security model**
- Funds cannot be moved directly
- Only executable via successful governance proposals
- Enforced through timelock‑controlled calls

---

## Hybrid Off‑Chain Voting Model

To illustrate modern DAO patterns, the system includes a conceptual off‑chain voting integration.

**Concept**
- Token holders vote off‑chain (e.g., Snapshot‑style)
- A trusted attester submits aggregated results on‑chain
- Execution still occurs on‑chain for transparency and security

This demonstrates how DAOs reduce gas costs while preserving trust.

---

## Security Approach

Security is a primary design focus.

- Uses battle‑tested OpenZeppelin contracts
- Timelock‑protected execution
- Role‑based permissions for critical operations
- Reentrancy safeguards
- Explicit validation checks
- Multisig‑controlled emergency pause

---

## Gas Efficiency Techniques

- Snapshot‑based voting power lookup
- Minimal storage writes
- Modular contract separation
- Optimized governance parameters

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- Docker (optional)

---

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

---

### Configure Environment

Create a local environment file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Set values such as:

- RPC endpoint URL  
- Deployment private key  

---

## Local Blockchain

Start a Hardhat node:

```
npx hardhat node
```

---

## Deployment

### Local Network

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Testnet (Example: Sepolia)

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

Deployment outputs contract addresses to the console.

---

## Governance Workflow

1. Delegate voting power
2. Submit a proposal
3. Vote during the active period
4. Reach quorum for approval
5. Queue proposal in timelock
6. Execute after delay expires

---

## Testing

Run all tests:

```
npx hardhat test
```

Coverage includes:

- Delegation mechanics
- Snapshot accuracy
- Proposal lifecycle
- Voting outcomes
- Timelock enforcement
- Edge cases and reverts
- Off‑chain voting simulation

---

## Docker Usage

Build and start services:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Provides:

- Local blockchain node
- Reproducible development environment
- Consistent CI‑like execution

---

## Design Rationale

- OpenZeppelin framework chosen for reliability
- Modular structure for maintainability
- Timelock ensures governance safety
- Event logs enable analytics and indexing
- Hybrid voting reflects real DAO practices

---

## Current Limitations

- No production Snapshot backend
- No frontend interface included
- Limited gas benchmarking
- Upgradeability not yet implemented

---

## Potential Enhancements

- Full Snapshot integration
- Web UI for governance participation
- On‑chain analytics dashboard
- Upgradeable contracts via proxy pattern
- Advanced treasury strategies

---

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the design of a secure, scalable, and realistic DAO governance system suitable for blockchain engineering portfolios and technical evaluations.
